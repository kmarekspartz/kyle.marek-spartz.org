[Mary](http://mary.marek-spartz.org) and I are homeowners in Roseville, Minnesota, raising a toddler and extending our home's resilience.

During the week, I manage engineers that are building resilient systems.

Twice a month, I facilitate [Resilience Coffee](https://www.resilience-coffee.org).

I serve on the board of [Saint Paul Neighbor Network](https://spnn.org).

I'm proud to have taken [a few pictures](https://kmarekspartz.posthaven.com).
