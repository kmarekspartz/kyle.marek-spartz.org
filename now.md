title: Now
description: What I'm working on now
---

[Mary](http://mary.marek-spartz.org) and I are new homeowners in Saint Paul,
Minnesota. We're getting settled and improving our home.

During the week, I engineer software and promote collaboration at
[GovDelivery](https://www.govdelivery.com/).

I also work on [other software](https://github.com/zeckalpha?tab=repositories).

I am (*very slowly*) writing [articles](/blog.html) about philosophy of software
development, history of programming languages, and distributed systems.

If my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was
April, 2016.
