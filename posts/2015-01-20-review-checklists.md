Review, reflection, and refinement should be part of your routine. I'm a loose follower of [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) and a heavy user of [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/guide/) (though I don't always use it in the way they suggest), but I've struggled to make reviews part of my routine. I made these checklists to lower the barrier of entry. In addition, I've created [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) goals to keep me on track.

Unlike most blog posts, this is a living document. I expect it to change. When It does, I plan to make notes of the changes at the bottom.
