[Jeff Knupp](http://www.jeffknupp.com/), author of [Idiomatic Python](http://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/) (No, not *that* [Idiomatic Python](http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html)) is on to something. Over the next few weeks, he'll be [reviewing](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/06/free-exposure-for-open-source-python-projects/) open source Python projects that readers of his blog work on. He knows from experience how difficult it is to get traction for personal projects.

I sent him an email about [Widely](http://www.celador.mn/widely/), and hope he'll get to review it!
