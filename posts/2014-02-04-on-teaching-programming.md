> [...] someone who [...] has enough leadership or influence to cause other programmers to write code like they would write without them having to do it, because you don't have the hours in the day or fingers. Having that ability to spread your approach and whatever you've learned about programming, and have that go through some kind of community and produce a corpus of code that's bigger than you could do, that's as satisfying to me as being the one that stays up all night writing too much code.
