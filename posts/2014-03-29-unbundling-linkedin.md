description: Why I don't have a LinkedIn account
---

I used to have a LinkedIn account. After their [password leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack) in 2012, I got rid of my account. At the time, I did not have a serious web presence, but I've [unbundled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbundling) my use of their services into this site. My [about page](/about.html) accounts for most of what LinkedIn provided me at the time.

Some may argue that what I have isn't social, though I do 'link in' to my collaborators web presences when I can. This linking not only helps our collective [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), but provides a connection to a distributed social web.

Since 2012, when I've seen other people use LinkedIn, I've been consistently surprised by the feature creep. LinkedIn has been attempting to gain features of blogging and mailing lists, while also providing feature-parity with Facebook, but focused on business instead of personal interactions. I'm not sold on the idea.

***Edit (June 2017):*** *I caved and recently created a LinkedIn [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-marek-spartz-463755141/).*
