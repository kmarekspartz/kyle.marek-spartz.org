description: Some thoughts on Swift

[Apple](https://www.apple.com) surprised the world at this year's [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/): They have been secretly working on a new programming language, [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/LandingPage/index.html), designed to minimize their reliance on Objective-C.

They called it Objective-C minus the C. Considering that Objective-C augments the semantics of C with the syntax of Smalltalk, this would imply that we would be left with the syntax Smalltalk. I don't think that Swift's syntax is like Smalltalk at all. Instead, one could say that Swift has the semantics of Smalltalk (or [Strongtalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongtalk)) with the syntax of C.

While reading the [introduction to Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097), I felt that the closest pre-existing language was Dart. There are quite a few differences, but there seems to be some convergent evolution. Given [Lars Bak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Bak_%28computer_programmer%29)'s work on Strongtalk, this isn't too surprising. Both are a departure from the Java and C++ object-orientation style, incorporating progress from type theory along the way.

I have a few issues with some of their language design decisions (which I plan to discuss in the coming weeks), but overall they made some good decisions (playgrounds!).
