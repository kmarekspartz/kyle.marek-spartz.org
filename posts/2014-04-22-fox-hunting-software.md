Another piece of "equipment" that I forgot to mention in [yesterday's post](/posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.html) is [Fox Hunt](http://foxhunt.rail.com/foxhunt/Home.html), an application for the iPhone which uses the phone's GPS and magnetometer to do orienteering. In addition, it will attempt to suggest a location of the fox once enough bearings are entered.
