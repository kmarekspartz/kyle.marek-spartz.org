There remain a few features that I'd like to add to this website, including links between adjacent posts, a list of recent posts in the side bar, automated building of my presentations and CV, and a [Gophermap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gophermap) back-end. There's a great community around [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), the static-site generator I use to compile this site, but discussing changes to my site without making the source available is no easy task. To facilitate this discussion, I've [open sourced](https://github.com/zeckalpha/kyle.marek-spartz.org) this website so that I can link to relevant portions when asking for assistance.
