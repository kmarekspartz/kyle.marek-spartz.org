[Mary](http://www.marypattison.com), KEØALJ, got her ham radio license this past week. To celebrate, we went to [HF in the Park](http://hamoperator.com/Park/). They had a fox hunt that I [mentioned recently](/posts/2014-05-01-fox-hunting-results.html).

We assembled the 2 meter portion of our [Cushcraft A270-6S](/posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.html) for the fox hunt, as it was on the 2 meter band. Parry, KCØTWB, supplied the fox, based on the [FoxBox](http://michiganfoxhunter.com/fox_common/k8jhr_foxbox.pdf).
