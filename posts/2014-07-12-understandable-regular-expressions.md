description: A friend of mine is working on an understandable regular expression implementation.

[Andrew Clarkson](https://github.com/bitborn) is working on a pure Python implementation of [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), with the intent to use it in a [lexer](https://github.com/bitborn/luther) for compiler implementation. One of his goals is to make it understandable and clear, one thing that doesn't often happen with regular expression implementations.
