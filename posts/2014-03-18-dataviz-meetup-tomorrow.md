The [Twin Cities (Data) Visualization Group](http://www.meetup.com/Twin-Cities-Visualization-Group/) will be [meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Twin-Cities-Visualization-Group/events/127527362/) tomorrow, Wednesday, March 19, from 6 pm to 9 pm at [Day Block Brewing Company](https://www.dayblockbrewing.com/). Normally they meet at [Clockwork](http://www.clockwork.net/) on third Tuesdays, but this month they are meeting at a larger venue on a different day to accommodate additional people from a [conference](https://pdmatcdv.eventbrite.com/) that afternoon. I've not been to one of their meetups before, but I'm definitely looking forward to this one!
