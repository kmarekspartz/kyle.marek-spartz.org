description: Expanding on the link between databases and category theory

It turns out that people more qualified than I are working on the link between [databases and category theory](/posts/2014-01-27-databases-primality-and-category-theory.html).

While perusing through my backlog of unread posts from [Edward Z. Yang](http://ezyang.com/), I came across this interesting [post](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/06/databases-are-categories/) from 2010 (I'm pretty far behind!). Some of the links from the post are dead, so I'll amend that here:

In 2010, [David Spivak](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/) gave a [tech talk entitled Databases are Categories](http://vimeo.com/channels/galois/12428370) at [Galois](http://corp.galois.com/). The [slides](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/talks/galois.pdf) are more digestible than the [paper](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/SD.pdf).
