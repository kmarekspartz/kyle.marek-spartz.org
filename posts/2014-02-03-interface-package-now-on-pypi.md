I've put the interface system that I've been discussing in [recent](/posts/2014-01-29-interfaces-in-python.html) [posts](/posts/2014-01-30-testing-interfaces-in-python.html) into [a package](https://github.com/zeckalpha/interface-mixins) now available [on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/interface-mixins).
