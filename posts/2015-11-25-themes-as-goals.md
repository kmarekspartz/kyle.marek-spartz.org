description: Use themes to clarify your goals

When defining goals, I've found themes to be more effective than particular
achievements. Themes give clarity of purpose and direction, even when the day to
day tactical priorities change. Does my plan for the day fit into my theme?

On the other hand, measuring progress against a theme is difficult. Instead of
measuring directly, we have to use proxies. Choose proxies carefully. Be
comfortable changing your proxy measurements even when you maintain the theme.
