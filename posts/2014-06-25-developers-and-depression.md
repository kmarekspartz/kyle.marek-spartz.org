description: Opening a dialogue about depression within the development community

The culture around software development is not nice to developers. While society tends to compensate them well financially, their mental condition is often overlooked. Given how important mental condition is to successful development, one would think employers and educators would pay closer attention and provide resources for developers. This stems from lack of awareness, which in turn is due to stigma discouraging open discussion about these issues. Let's open up that discussion.

In August, [Greg Baugues](http://baugues.com/) from [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) will be giving a talk on developers and depression at the [Minnesota PHP user group](http://www.meetup.com/mn-php/). Now, I'm not a fan of PHP, but this may be one of the most important events for developers in the area this summer. There are quite a few tickets remaining, so please [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/minnesota-prompt-developers-and-depression-tickets-11991311335).
