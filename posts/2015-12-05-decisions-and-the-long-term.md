description: Marginal maintenance costs are much more important than fixed initial costs when making business decisions
---

When making business decisions, people often use initial or fixed costs to
justify their decision. While being difficult to estimate, they still are much
easier to estimate than maintenance and marginal costs. However, in the long
term, maintenance and marginal costs will outweigh initial and fixed costs, so
careful attention must be paid to marginal maintenance costs.

![Long term costs increase for marginal or maintenance costs, and increase
significantly for marginal maintenance
costs.](/images/marginal-maintenance-costs.png)

Let's consider each combination. While a given cost isn't categorically in one
quadrant, these dimensions can be used to conceptualize relative costs of
alternatives under consideration.


### Fixed initial costs

These are one time costs that are always necessary to take a given path, even
in an ideal world.


### Marginal initial costs

These are inefficiencies in implementing a decision that are included each time
you make similar decisions. Bureaucracy, redundant efforts, and technical debt
are three examples.


### Fixed maintenance costs

These are the base recurring costs that you must incur as a consequence of your
decision. Flat membership or licensing fees are a good example.


### Marginal maintenance costs

These are recurring costs that grow proportionally to the number of customers
are affected the outcome of your decision. Hiring people or paying for more
computers are examples of this. Minimizing these costs has more benefit than
reducing the other three types because they are recurring and growing.
