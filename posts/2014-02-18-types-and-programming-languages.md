I'd like to learn more about type systems, so I'm working my way through [Benjamin C. Pierce](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/)'s [Types and Programming Languages](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/). I also would like to learn more about Haskell, so I'm implementing languages from the book as I encounter them. If you'd like to follow along, the implementations I'm working on are on [GitHub](https://github.com/zeckalpha/TaPL).

Before this I hadn't done any significant multiple-file Haskell work, so I'm particularly looking for feedback on the project's structure and whether it is idiomatic.
