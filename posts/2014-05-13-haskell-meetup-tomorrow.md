[HaskellMN](http://www.haskell.mn) will be [meeting](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/181725802/) tomorrow, Wednesday May 14, from 7 to 9 pm at [GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/), sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102). This location has a projector, so weâ€™ll be celebrating with lightning talks. I'll be giving a talk on [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). See you there!
