[We](http://www.haskell.mn)’ll be [meeting](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/159531772/) tonight, from 6:30 to 8 pm at [Verdant Tea](http://minneapolis.verdanttea.com/). We’ll be catching up on what’s new with everyone, and then work together through the [Haskell Koans](https://github.com/HaskVan/HaskellKoans) to compare approaches to problem solving. See you there!
