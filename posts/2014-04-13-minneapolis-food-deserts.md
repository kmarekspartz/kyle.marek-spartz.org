After living for 3 years on the University of Minnesota campus, I decided I couldn't stand it any longer: I needed a car. Getting groceries was tough.

[Mary Pattison](http://mary.marek-spartz.org), my fianc√©e, is currently taking an urban planning course for her master's degree in GIS. For her final project, she collected a list of grocery stores in Minneapolis and used a [Euclidean distance](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//009z0000001p000000) analysis to calculate minimum walking distance of any point in Minneapolis to a grocery store.
