For her master's coursework, [Mary](http://www.marypattison.com) is taking a class on spatial data methodology. She wanted to do a radio direction finding final project, but since I haven't done much with my ham radio license recently, this was a good chance to invest in some equipment:

![*[Adept Instruments](http://www.adeptco.com/adeptinstruments/) [T400P-6 fox hunting transmitter](http://www.adeptco.com/adeptinstruments/fox.htm).*](/images/2014-04-17-foxhunt/T400-6P1.gif)

It transmits using AM on the 70 cm band. Every 85 seconds it transmits my call sign (KDÃ˜GTK), and then it beeps every 1.3 seconds for 50 milliseconds.

![*[Cushcraft](http://www.cushcraftamateur.com/) [A270-6S Yagi antenna](http://www.cushcraftamateur.com/Product.php?productid=A270-6S).*](/images/2014-04-17-foxhunt/A270-6S.jpg)

This antenna is two 3-element Yagi antennas, one each for the 2 m and 70 cm bands. For now, we've only assembled the 70 cm antenna, but we'll put together the rest before our [next fox hunt](http://hamoperator.com/Park/), as it will use 2 m.

![*[Yaesu](http://yaesu.com/) [VX-3R handheld transceiver](http://yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&ProdCatID=111&encProdID=5CB596EBED9A3EE26635C7E1F02500D9).* ](/images/2014-04-17-foxhunt/VX-3R.jpg)

I've used this handheld before, and have always been impressed with its durability, battery life, and receiver coverage.

I'll tell you how the fox hunt went in a later [post](/posts/2014-05-01-fox-hunting-results.html).
