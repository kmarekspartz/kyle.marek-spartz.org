[Danny Gratzer](http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/about.html), the organizer of [HaskellMN](http://www.haskell.mn), has been reviewing packages from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/) to demonstrate his approach to understanding new code. So far he's reviewed [`logict`](http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/posts/2014-07-10-reading-logict.html), a [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) [monad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29), and [`extensible-effects`](http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/posts/2014-07-15-reading-extensible-effects.html), an alternative to the [monad-transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_transformer) approach. They're good reads even if you don't know any Haskell, as he describes how he traverses files in a code base using [`find`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find) and [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep).
