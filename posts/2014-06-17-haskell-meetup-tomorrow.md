[HaskellMN](http://www.haskell.mn) will be [meeting](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/183278682/) tomorrow, Wednesday June 18, from 7 to 9 pm at [GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/), sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102). We're having a beginner's night, so feel free to ask questions on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HaskellMN/beginners-night-questions/issues) or the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn). Weâ€™ll help each other out with everything from getting GHC installed to the difference between Applicatives and Monoids. If we run out of questions, we [may](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/haskellmn/GUOBw7Z-Ekw) even get started on making a Twitter bot. See you there!
