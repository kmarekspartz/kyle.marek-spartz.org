I keep forgetting to mention that Apple has fixed one of the issues I
had with Swift. In Beta 3, the syntax for Array at the type level has
changed from `String[]` to `[String]`, which corresponds better to the
value-level syntax for Arrays. Credit to

**Edit:** I should also link to Apple's [blog post](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=3) announcing the changes.
