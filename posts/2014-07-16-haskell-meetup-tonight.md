[HaskellMN](http://www.haskell.mn) will be meeting tonight, Wednesday
July 16, from 7 to 9 pm at [GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/),
sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

We'll review what we did in the split groups [last
month](http://www.haskell.mn/posts/2014-06-27-events-predating-the-blog.html),
then split again into an introductory group and continuing work on
[our Twitter
bot](https://github.com/HaskellMN/haskell-mn-twitter-bot).  Feel free
to switch groups if you felt you were in the wrong one last month, or
if you didn't attend last month, join in where you feel
comfortable. If you have questions you'd like answered at the event,
please open an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/HaskellMN/beginners-night-questions/issues),
or ask on the [Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn) or on the
[Meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/191666152/).
