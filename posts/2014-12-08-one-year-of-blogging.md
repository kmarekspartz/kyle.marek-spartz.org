description: A look back over some recent posts from this blog
---

In the last year, I've written 103 posts (an average of one every three and a
half days) for a total of 20,183 words.

In the last six months, I've written 24 posts, for a total of 6,223 words.
Compared to my [first six months](/posts/2014-06-08-six-months-of-blogging.html)
of blogging, my post quantity is definitely down, but my word count per post is
up (~260 words compared to ~178), which may be a naive
[estimate of quality](/posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.html).
