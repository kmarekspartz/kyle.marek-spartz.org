This Saturday, April 5, the second annual [Minnesota Undergraduate Linguistics Symposium](http://linguistics.mn) (MULS) will be happening at Rapson Hall on the University of Minnesota East Bank campus. I was on the MULS organizing committee last year, and have enjoyed assisting this year's organizers when they had questions. They have managed to improve upon the concept, and I look forward to being there on Saturday. I'll be participating in the Forum at the end of the day entitled, 'Marketing Your Linguistics Degree'.
