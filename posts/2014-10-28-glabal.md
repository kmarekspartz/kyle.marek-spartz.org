description: Global sandboxes for Cabal
---

I recently moved to a new laptop and decided to rethink my GHC and
[`cabal`](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/) setup. After installing
[GHC for Mac OS X](http://ghcformacosx.github.io/) and running `cabal
install cabal-install`, I decided not to install any other cabal
packages globally in order to avoid
[cabal hell](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cabal+hell). However, there are
a few programs I link to install globally with `cabal`,
e.g. [`pandoc`](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). I asked
[Tyler Holien](https://twitter.com/tylerholien) what he does, and he
suggested a separate cabal sandbox for each program and a
[symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) to the
resulting binary somewhere on my
[`$PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_%28variable%29).

I created a script called `glabal` to do the first part of this work
for me:

```bash
# ~/bin/glabal:
mkdir -p ~/.installs/$1
pushd ~/.installs/$1
cabal sandbox init
cabal install $1 -j8
popd
```

To use this, I type `glabal pandoc` and it creates a sandbox in
`.installs/pandoc` and attempts to install pandoc. If this doesn't
complete successfully, I either `rm -r .install/pandoc` or go into the
sandbox manually and attempt to recover.
