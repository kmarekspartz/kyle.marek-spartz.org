Hello!

I work in the [Speech Informatics Lab](http://rxinformatics.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota â€“ College of Pharmacy, where we are researching Alzheimer's prediction using speech recognition. I also work on projects for [Celador](http://www.celador.mn), and I enjoy reading about the linguistics of programming languages.
