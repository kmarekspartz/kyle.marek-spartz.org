# **Kyle Marek-Spartz**

*Engineering software, reliability, and collaboration.*

I find again and again that improving how we work yields better returns than
working on the software directly, so I aim to do that as much as possible. I'm a
big believer in 1-1s, TDD, pairing, continuous delivery, and retrospectives. I
have found great value working with cross-functional and distributed teams.
