posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:4: How I use Widely to deploy Hakyll sites --- I've been using [widely](http://www.celador.mn/widely) and [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) together for a little [while -> (if used as substitute for "and, but" then replace by semicolon, do not use as substitute for "although" as it leads to ambiguity or absurdity, best use it only in the sense of "during the time that")] now for a few different sites.

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:9: The quickest setup is to `cd` into `_[site -> (a "site" is a place, a "sight" is related to "seeing")]` and `widely sites:create <SITENAME>`.

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:9: [However -> Means "in whatever way, to whatever extent" inside a sentence and "nevertheless" at the beginning of a sentence.] this setup involves [a lot of -> Often obsolete, should sometimes be replaced by "many"] `cd`-ing for deployment.

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:9: [In order to -> to] minimize `cd`-ing, I added a `deployCommand` to my Hakyll configuration as follows:

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:12: Configuration { deployCommand = "pushd _[site -> (a "site" is a place, a "sight" is related to "seeing")] && widely push && popd" } ``` This makes building and deploying:

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:21: [However -> Means "in whatever way, to whatever extent" inside a sentence and "nevertheless" at the beginning of a sentence.], widely creates a `.widely` file in [its -> = "it is" or "its"?] source directory, [which -> (use "that" if clause is restrictive)] in this [case -> Avoid if used to describe the instance of a situation.] is Hakyll's `_[site -> (a "site" is a place, a "sight" is related to "seeing")]`, and I wouldn't store `_[site -> (a "site" is a place, a "sight" is related to "seeing")]` in a version control repository for the [site -> (a "site" is a place, a "sight" is related to "seeing")].

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:21: Ideally, the `.widely` file [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] be stored in the root of the repository.

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:21: We [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] put the `.widely` there and have Hakyll move the `.widely` into `_[site -> (a "site" is a place, a "sight" is related to "seeing")]`.

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:25: First, the globs don't work the way I thought [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] do.

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:27: Second, Hakyll ignores dotfiles by default, [so -> (do not use as intensifier)] we need to change the `ignoreFile` function in the configuration:

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:30: Configuration { deployCommand = "pushd _[site -> (a "site" is a place, a "sight" is related to "seeing")] && widely push && popd" , ignoreFile = [ignoreFile -> Double word.]' } where ignoreFile' path | ".widely" `isPrefixOf` fileName = False | ".

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:37: PrefixOf` fileName = True | "#" `isPrefixOf` fileName = True | "~" `isSuffixOf` fileName = True | ".swp" `isSuffixOf` fileName = True | otherwise = False where fileName = takeFileName path ``` I've been [very -> (use sparingly; try to use words that are strong in themselves for emphasis)] happy with this setup, though there remains [one -> When used as a pronoun, it  must be used consistently: One must manage one's money carefully.] issue:

posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:46: I think it'll just take getting used to calling `./[site -> (a "site" is a place, a "sight" is related to "seeing")] deploy` instead.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:7: Losing keys is an ordeal, but thankfully I'm not going through it [presently -> (do not use as substitute for "now", restrict to synonym for "soon")].

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:9: What if each set of keys had a [unique -> ("unique" or "uncommon"?)] identifier on it?

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:9: It turns out, [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] nearly already do.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:9: [They -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] keyhole and the teeth of each key provide us with the information we need.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:11: If the average person had a way of cataloging this information, [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] [could -> (do not confuse with "may")] get replacements from a locksmith.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:11: Perhaps there should be an app [which -> (use "that" if clause is restrictive)] takes pictures of your keys and stores this information for you.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:11: [There are -> (a dead phrase; rewrite the sentence and it will probably improve)] already [methods](http://vision.ucsd.edu/~blaxton/pagePapers/laxton_wang_savage_ccs2008.pdf) for reconstructing keys using pictures from afar.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:11: I am assuming it [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] be even easier to get good photos when the photographer and the key owner are the same person.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:13: Reconstructing existing keys [may -> = Do not confuse with "can".] be easier [than -> (examine sentences containing "than" to insure that they are not missing words: I love my father more than my mother. I love my father more than my mother loves my father. I love my father more than I love my mother)] switching out all of your locks, but since the original keys are still out in the world somewhere, you [may -> = Do not confuse with "can".] need to switch out all of your locks anyway.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:13: What if we [could -> (do not confuse with "may")] get our original keys back?

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:15: Perhaps there needs to be a service where you [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] upload information about a set of keys and your [contact -> When used as a transitive verb, "contact" is a poor choice. Get in touch with someone, or call them, instead of contacting them.] information.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:15: Then when someone finds your keys, [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] upload images of your keys and get your [contact -> When used as a transitive verb, "contact" is a poor choice. Get in touch with someone, or call them, instead of contacting them.] information.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:17: In order for someone to know to go to this service, either everyone [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] need to know about it and use it, or there [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] need to be a [key tag](http://www.plastickeytag.com/) advertising this service, and providing a bar-code identifier for the set of keys.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:17: [However -> Means "in whatever way, to whatever extent" inside a sentence and "nevertheless" at the beginning of a sentence.], a key tag [could -> (do not confuse with "may")] simply have the phone number or some other [contact -> When used as a transitive verb, "contact" is a poor choice. Get in touch with someone, or call them, instead of contacting them.] information, [so -> (do not use as intensifier)] this service [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] be unnecessary.

posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:17: Perhaps someone should sell low-quantity key tag printing for [contact -> When used as a transitive verb, "contact" is a poor choice. Get in touch with someone, or call them, instead of contacting them.] information.

posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:2: Never Blame [People -> Do not use with numbers or as substitute for "public".] tags:

posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:4: Computer programs should not blame [people -> Do not use with numbers or as substitute for "public".] for their own failings --- Many [people -> Do not use with numbers or as substitute for "public".] don't [like -> Substitute by "as" before phrases or clauses: Our love was beautiful, as love was meant to be.] using computers because [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] internalize computer problems when things go wrong.

posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:7: [People -> Do not use with numbers or as substitute for "public".] blame themselves when computers don't behave as [expected -> Use "expect" for simple predictions and "anticipate" for more complex actions in advance of an event.].

posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:9: [One -> When used as a pronoun, it  must be used consistently: One must manage one's money carefully.] [attempt -> try] to fix this [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] be to provide better error messages.

posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:9: By telling [people -> Do not use with numbers or as substitute for "public".] what is wrong, rather [than -> (examine sentences containing "than" to insure that they are not missing words: I love my father more than my mother. I love my father more than my mother loves my father. I love my father more than I love my mother)] telling them that something went wrong, software [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] empower [people -> Do not use with numbers or as substitute for "public".] to adjust the necessary conditions to fix the problem.

posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:11: Another current trend [which -> (use "that" if clause is restrictive)] [people -> Do not use with numbers or as substitute for "public".] internalize is obfuscated UI.

posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:11: When [people -> Do not use with numbers or as substitute for "public".] cannot find a menu because it is [hidden off the edge of the screen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), or buttons are labeled with [abstract icons](http://gmail.com), [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] blame themselves.

posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:13: Software needs to teach [people -> Do not use with numbers or as substitute for "public".] not to blame themselves for things beyond their control.

posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:7: [There is -> (a dead phrase; rewrite the sentence and it will probably improve)] [PEP 443](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0443/), but I'm not a fan for how verbose that is.

posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:9: We [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] use dictionaries to do basic pattern matching.

posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:20: We [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] use any expression to dispatch the `abs_dict`.

posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:20: This allows for more complex patterns [than -> (examine sentences containing "than" to insure that they are not missing words: I love my father more than my mother. I love my father more than my mother loves my father. I love my father more than I love my mother)] just `True` and `False`.

posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:345: For example, the contract `-2 or Positive` takes the -2 contract [which -> (use "that" if clause is restrictive)] checks for equality with -2, and the Positive contract [which -> (use "that" if clause is restrictive)] checks for a positive number, and unifies them into a composite contract.

posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:351: These contract combinators along with a minimization function [may -> = Do not confuse with "can".] provide a form of pragmatic reasoning for programming languages.

posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:7: [Most -> Do not use as substitute for "almost."] of the redditors seemed to insist that JSON is fully schema-[less -> Use "less" for quantities and "fewer" for numbers.] and thus should have `AnyObject` as [its -> = "it is" or "its"?] representation, to keep things fully dynamic.

posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:9: But JSON isn't really as dynamic as [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] are claiming.

posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:9: Since [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] used `AnyObject` to represent a JSON object, this caused their frustration with [downcasting](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TypeCasting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH22-XID_446).

posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:10: For each post, I've been adding a data point with a value of [one -> When used as a pronoun, it  must be used consistently: One must manage one's money carefully.], with a goal pace of about four posts per week.

posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:11: [However -> Means "in whatever way, to whatever extent" inside a sentence and "nevertheless" at the beginning of a sentence.], because each post had the same value, I had inadvertently set my sights for quantity over quality.

posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:20: Naively, I [could -> (do not confuse with "may")] change my goal to be *N* words per week (where *N* is initially my historic rate), but this [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] result in a different accidental prioritization of quantity over quality:

posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:22: I [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] write longer posts, not necessarily better posts.

posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:28: I'm unsure how exactly to calculate quality, [so -> (do not use as intensifier)] instead of guessing, I'm developing a set of features each of which I'll mind[^1] with Beeminder separately.

posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:30: I'll then manually rate my previous posts and develop a model [which -> (use "that" if clause is restrictive)] [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] assign a rating to a post using the features.

posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:32: Eventually, I [may -> = Do not confuse with "can".] ask some prototypical readers to rate my posts.

posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:33: I [could -> (do not confuse with "may")] then develop a model for each set of ratings.

posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:44: This [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] be simple, such as how many new words were introduced in this blog post, or more complex, such as [vector-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model) [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_%28mathematics%29).

posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:49: Measurements are important, as [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] do change behavior, but what we measure [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] sometimes have unintended consequences.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:25: This reminded me that I wanted to [compare -> "Compare" to points out resemblances, "compare with" points out differences.] the import styles of Python, Haskell, and Swift.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:26: Their imports are similar, though [there are -> (a dead phrase; rewrite the sentence and it will probably improve)] a few differences to keep in mind.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:45: The first is useful for short names (`os`, `sys`), but with module hierarchies it [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] be annoying.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:46: The second is my preferred style, as it forces you to name what [will -> (shall is sometimes used with first person pronouns and the future tense. It expresses something you believe will happen, not something that you are determined to do. A drowning man shouts: "I shall drown, no one will save me!")] be used.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:47: The third is frowned upon, as you [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] accidentally overwrite variables if a module you import later provides an object with the same name as [one -> When used as a pronoun, it  must be used consistently: One must manage one's money carefully.] you import earlier.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:51: Explicit is better [than -> (examine sentences containing "than" to insure that they are not missing words: I love my father more than my mother. I love my father more than my mother loves my father. I love my father more than I love my mother)] implicit.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:55: Submodules [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] be placed in the folder.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:62: Python imports [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] be qualified using `as`:

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:70: Python imports [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] also happen anywhere in a file, even [inside -> ] functions.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:91: These correspond loosely to the three Python examples, [however -> Means "in whatever way, to whatever extent" inside a sentence and "nevertheless" at the beginning of a sentence.], I put them in the roughly similar semantic order, rather [than -> (examine sentences containing "than" to insure that they are not missing words: I love my father more than my mother. I love my father more than my mother loves my father. I love my father more than I love my mother)] by ordering them by their similar syntax.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:93: Again, I prefer the middle [one -> When used as a pronoun, it  must be used consistently: One must manage one's money carefully.] for similar reasons.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:96: [There is -> (a dead phrase; rewrite the sentence and it will probably improve)] also a `hiding` option, [which -> (use "that" if clause is restrictive)] is the inverse of [of -> Double word.] the second option [option -> Double word.] above:

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:116: Haskell provides the `as` option, too, though [only -> Put "only" right before the word it modifies.] for module-level imports:

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:119: Haskell import Module as M import qualified Module as M ~~~ [However -> Means "in whatever way, to whatever extent" inside a sentence and "nevertheless" at the beginning of a sentence.], the first example here also imports everything from `Module` in addition to qualifying the module-level import as `M`.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:128: This [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] import everything from `Module` *except* `a`, `b`, and `c`.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:135: [They -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] [only -> Put "only" right before the word it modifies.] provide equivalents for the second and third examples from above:

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:148: [Compared -> "Compare" to points out resemblances, "compare with" points out differences.] to the `module2` examples from Python and Haskell, the example here provides two additional constraints.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:150: In the example I gave here the import kind is `var`, though it [could -> (do not confuse with "may")] also be `typealias`, `struct`, `class`, `enum`, `protocol`, or `func`.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:152: The other constraint is each import from a module [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] need to be in [its -> = "it is" or "its"?] own line.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:153: A more precise equivalent to the Python and Haskell examples for [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] be:

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:162: I think a better syntax [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] be something [like -> Substitute by "as" before phrases or clauses: Our love was beautiful, as love was meant to be.] [one -> When used as a pronoun, it  must be used consistently: One must manage one's money carefully.] of these:

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:193: Python x = 1 [x -> Double word.] = 2 from a import * from b import * print(x) ~~~ These suggestions are reflected in Python's [PEP 8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports) and the HaskellWiki page on ["Import[ing] modules properly"](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Import_modules_properly).

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:209: These discuss the merits of the various import styles, and [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] arrive at similar conclusions, though the HaskellWiki page is [less -> Use "less" for quantities and "fewer" for numbers.] axiomatic and provides more rationale for the various decisions.

posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:212: [There is -> (a dead phrase; rewrite the sentence and it will probably improve)] not yet a similar document for Swift, though the official blog post on [Files and Initialization](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=7) mentions that you "[can -> (do not confuse with "may")] even import modules at the bottom of the file (although that is not recommended Swift style.

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:18: A data structure is [considered -> Not followed by "as" when it means "believe to be".] eventually consistent if two instances [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] reach a consistent [state -> (if used as a verb, restrict to the meaning of "express fully or clearly")] given the same unordered set of [state -> (if used as a verb, restrict to the meaning of "express fully or clearly")] changes.

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:19: Two databases are eventually consistent if all actions taken in [one -> When used as a pronoun, it  must be used consistently: One must manage one's money carefully.] propagate to the other.

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:22: Strong eventual consistency [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] be achieved if [state -> (if used as a verb, restrict to the meaning of "express fully or clearly")] changes are [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property), [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property), and [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:27: [State -> (if used as a verb, restrict to the meaning of "express fully or clearly")] changes are commutative if swapping two operations yields the same [state -> (if used as a verb, restrict to the meaning of "express fully or clearly")].

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:28: For example, these two operations [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] apply in either order to yield a logically equivalent table:

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:31: SQL INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) VALUES (1); INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) VALUES (2); ~~~ Similarly, [state -> (if used as a verb, restrict to the meaning of "express fully or clearly")] changes are associative if three operations [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] be paired either way yielding the same [state -> (if used as a verb, restrict to the meaning of "express fully or clearly")].

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:37: For example, three databases each with [one -> When used as a pronoun, it  must be used consistently: One must manage one's money carefully.] of the following operations [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] be merged as (1 + 2) + 3 or 1 + (2 + 3) to yield a logically equivalent table:

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:63: SQL DELETE FROM some_table WHERE some_column = 4; ~~~ We [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] limit DML to `SELECT`s and `INSERT`s to avoid using other synchronization methods.

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:68: Avoiding updates and deletes provides [immutability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object), [which -> (use "that" if clause is restrictive)] guarantees a row [will -> (shall is sometimes used with first person pronouns and the future tense. It expresses something you believe will happen, not something that you are determined to do. A drowning man shouts: "I shall drown, no one will save me!")] not change or disappear from our databases.

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:72: By staying `INSERT`-[only -> Put "only" right before the word it modifies.], we treat our database as a [persistent data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure), or an append-[only -> Put "only" right before the word it modifies.] commit log.

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:76: Immutability and persistence helps with eventual consistency, but [they -> (do not use as substitute for "each, each one, everybody, every one, anybody, any one, somebody, some one")] are not [sufficient -> enough].

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:77: [State -> (if used as a verb, restrict to the meaning of "express fully or clearly")] changes are idempotent if repeatedly applying the same [state -> (if used as a verb, restrict to the meaning of "express fully or clearly")] change yields the same [state -> (if used as a verb, restrict to the meaning of "express fully or clearly")].

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:82: SQL SELECT DISTINCT some_column FROM some_table; ~~~ Another way to achieve idempotence is to use a [unique -> ("unique" or "uncommon"?)] constraint to prevent duplicates from being inserted and ignore [unique -> ("unique" or "uncommon"?)] constraint violations upon insertion.

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:89: We [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] also manually check for duplicates during an insert:

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:91: SQL INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) SELECT 4 WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM some_table WHERE some_column = 4 ); ~~~ How [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] we delete an item from our database without using SQL `DELETE`?

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:103: Instead of `DELETE`ing the row, we [can -> (do not confuse with "may")] create a marker in another table that says an object is deleted.

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:113: SQL SELECT some_table.* FROM some_table WHERE id NOT IN ( SELECT some_table_id FROM some_table_deletions ); ~~~ If we want to support deletion and re-adding of the same value, we cannot use a [unique -> ("unique" or "uncommon"?)] constraint for idempotence since the [unique -> ("unique" or "uncommon"?)] constraint [would -> (use "should" if used as conditional statement in the first person or for "shall" in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense.  Consider omitting it for repeated actions)] prevent the addition of the new row.

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:124: Instead, either de-duplicate at query time using `DISTINCT` or prevent duplicates from getting inserted without using a [unique -> ("unique" or "uncommon"?)] constraint:

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:128: SQL INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) SELECT 4 WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM some_table WHERE some_column = 4 AND id NOT IN ( SELECT some_table_id FROM some_table_deletions ) ); ~~~ At this point it looks [like -> Substitute by "as" before phrases or clauses: Our love was beautiful, as love was meant to be.] we'll need to [normalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) our database, or structure our data in a particular way [in order to -> to] satisfy these properties.

posts/2013-12-08-welcome.md:4: Welcome to Kyle Marek-Spartz's blog!
posts/2013-12-08-welcome.md:9: This blog is to provide a venue for a variety of ideas that have been bouncing around for a while, with no real place to share them with the world.
posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:4: How I use Widely to deploy Hakyll sites --- I've been using [widely](http://www.celador.mn/widely) and [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) together for a little while now for a few different sites.
posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:9: However this setup involves a lot of `cd`-ing for deployment.
posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:9: In order to minimize `cd`-ing, I added a `deployCommand` to my Hakyll configuration as follows:
posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:12: Configuration { deployCommand = "pushd _site && widely push && popd" } ``` This makes building and deploying:
posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:21: However, widely creates a `.widely` file in its source directory, which in this case is Hakyll's `_site`, and I wouldn't store `_site` in a version control repository for the site.
posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:23: To do this, I initially added `".widely*"` to the list of file identifiers going into the `idRoute` and the `copyFileCompiler`.
posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:27: Second, Hakyll ignores dotfiles by default, so we need to change the `ignoreFile` function in the configuration:
posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:30: Configuration { deployCommand = "pushd _site && widely push && popd" , ignoreFile = ignoreFile' } where ignoreFile' path | ".widely" `isPrefixOf` fileName = False | ".
posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:37: PrefixOf` fileName = True | "#" `isPrefixOf` fileName = True | "~" `isSuffixOf` fileName = True | ".swp" `isSuffixOf` fileName = True | otherwise = False where fileName = takeFileName path ``` I've been very happy with this setup, though there remains one issue:
posts/2013-12-09-widely-and-hakyll.md:46: With the `.widely` file in multiple locations, occasionally I'll accidentally call `widely push` in the root of the repository.
posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:9: They keyhole and the teeth of each key provide us with the information we need.
posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:11: If the average person had a way of cataloging this information, they could get replacements from a locksmith.
posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:11: Perhaps there should be an app which takes pictures of your keys and stores this information for you.
posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:11: There are already [methods](http://vision.ucsd.edu/~blaxton/pagePapers/laxton_wang_savage_ccs2008.pdf) for reconstructing keys using pictures from afar.
posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:13: Reconstructing existing keys may be easier than switching out all of your locks, but since the original keys are still out in the world somewhere, you may need to switch out all of your locks anyway.
posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:15: Perhaps there needs to be a service where you can upload information about a set of keys and your contact information.
posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:15: Then when someone finds your keys, they would upload images of your keys and get your contact information.
posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:17: In order for someone to know to go to this service, either everyone would need to know about it and use it, or there would need to be a [key tag](http://www.plastickeytag.com/) advertising this service, and providing a bar-code identifier for the set of keys.
posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:17: However, a key tag could simply have the phone number or some other contact information, so this service would be unnecessary.
posts/2013-12-10-lost-keys.md:17: Perhaps someone should sell low-quantity key tag printing for contact information.
posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:4: Computer programs should not blame people for their own failings --- Many people don't like using computers because they internalize computer problems when things go wrong.
posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:9: Instead of 'Operation Failed', software should report why the operation failed.
posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:9: Network connectivity?
posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:9: By telling people what is wrong, rather than telling them that something went wrong, software can empower people to adjust the necessary conditions to fix the problem.
posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:11: Another current trend which people internalize is obfuscated UI.
posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:11: When people cannot find a menu because it is [hidden off the edge of the screen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), or buttons are labeled with [abstract icons](http://gmail.com), they blame themselves.
posts/2013-12-11-never-blame-people.md:13: Software needs to teach people not to blame themselves for things beyond their control.
posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:4: Implementing pattern matching and singular dispatch in Python --- [Pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching) and [singular dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch) are useful tools not readily usable in Python.
posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:9: Here's an absolute value function:
posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:20: This function takes an `int` or a `string` and returns more:
posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:34: This used singular dispatch to choose which implementation to use.
posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:38: OrderedDict class singular_dispatch(OrderedDict):
posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:46: By inheriting from `dict`, our singular_dispatch objects can function like any other dictionary, and has all of its methods.[^1] We want singular dispatch objects to also function as a function, so we add a `__call__` method.
posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:46: The call method uses the type of its first argument (other than `self`) to dispatch which function within `self` to use.
posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:48: This simplifies the definition of `more`:
posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:68: Inheriting from [OrderedDict](http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict) isn’t strictly necessary in this case, but it is useful for the `singular_dispatch` class since it remembers the order in which keys are added.
posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.md:70: Including `update`.
posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:4: Providing more implementations for a singular dispatch method --- In my earlier [singular dispatch post](/posts/2013-12-12-pattern-matching-and-singular-dispatch-in-python.html), I suggested that the `update` method of the `singular_dispatch` class is quite useful.
posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:7: One place I'm using it is for an implementation of [QuickCheck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) in Python[^1].
posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:11: An important aspect of QuickCheck is an `arbitrary` function which returns a random value of a specified type.
posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:11: Assuming we have a `random_int` function, we can create an initial `arbitrary` function which works for `int`:
posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:25: Arbitrary Bool where arbitrary = ... ... ~~~~ Back in Python land, we can add another instance to `arbitrary` using the `update` method:
posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:38: The preferred notation would be `cls.arbitrary()`.
posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:38: This mixin provides that notation for classes which inherit from it[^2]:
posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:40: This mixin does not provide the object-oriented notation for primitive types.

posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:66: It would not still be an `int` due to Python casting on overflow.) This is reminiscent of `deriving` in Haskell, though nowhere near as powerful.
posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:70: This even works for complex data structures such as Trees, as long as the structure is defined in arbitrary appropriately.
posts/2013-12-18-singular-dispatch-and-update.md:70: To do so, we create a class combinator which returns a random arbitrary function:

posts/2014-01-27-databases-primality-and-category-theory.md:9: If we think of `JOIN` as a multiplication operation, and the multiplicative inverse as splitting a table into two tables, the equivalent process to prime factorization would be database normalization!

posts/2014-02-17-props-now-on-pypi.md:19: In Haskell's QuickCheck, Arbitrary is a typeclass:
posts/2014-02-17-props-now-on-pypi.md:26: The way to read this definition is "Any class `a` which implements the `Arbitrary` interface must provide a method `arbitrary` which returns a `Gen a`.
posts/2014-02-17-props-now-on-pypi.md:26: Think of `Gen a` as a container which can be turned into random instances of `a`.[^1] To create new instance of `Arbitrary`[^2]:

posts/2014-02-17-props-now-on-pypi.md:55: Classmethods are just functions which dispatch on the type given, so we can define arbitrary somewhat like this[^3]:

posts/2014-02-17-props-now-on-pypi.md:71: This way we can provide implementations of arbitrary for already defined types (either in the standard library or in external libraries) in `arbitrary_dict`, and also handle instances of `ArbitraryInterface` for our own classes.

posts/2014-02-19-sacrificing-safety-for-flexibility.md:9: For static, we get a reasonable amount of assurance that certain classes of bugs cannot occur.
posts/2014-02-19-sacrificing-safety-for-flexibility.md:11: In databases, one ongoing trend is the popularity of NoSQL systems, particularly key-value stores.
posts/2014-02-19-sacrificing-safety-for-flexibility.md:11: One argument for key-value stores is their flexibility.
posts/2014-02-19-sacrificing-safety-for-flexibility.md:13: The main argument for flexibility in both dynamic languages and key-value stores is how fast a prototype can be made since there is little need to account for changes in schema or typing.
posts/2014-02-19-sacrificing-safety-for-flexibility.md:13: However, when these systems need to be made robust later on, developers end up making code to account for the schema or typing in their system.
posts/2014-02-19-sacrificing-safety-for-flexibility.md:15: In SQL databases, we can denormalize and put everything in one table, and use nullable strings for every column type.

posts/2014-02-20-props-gen-a-thunks-and-closures.md:55: In Python, iterators can be thought of as lazy, but they usually represent collections of objects, rather than just a single object, so this would not be the best use of iterators.
posts/2014-02-20-props-gen-a-thunks-and-closures.md:59: One simple way to implement a thunk is to make a closure which takes no arguments.

posts/2014-02-20-props-gen-a-thunks-and-closures.md:80: Since [objects are closures](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ClosuresAndObjectsAreEquivalent), we can view the class definition for `Tree` as setting up a closure, which we force when we call `arbitrary`.

posts/2014-02-21-restful-email.md:11: First, instead of our usual email addresses, we'd have routes, so my email, <kyle.marek.spartz@gmail.com>, would look more like:
posts/2014-02-21-restful-email.md:30: GET gmail.com/kyle.marek.spartz/labels/spam URL query strings on GETs could be used to filter results by the email metadata:
posts/2014-02-21-restful-email.md:34: GET gmail.com/kyle.marek.spartz?from=gmail.com%2Fmichaeljburling To send an email, we could POST to someone else's inbox, with the message content in the request body:
posts/2014-02-21-restful-email.md:39: POST gmail.com/michaeljburling For security, we can incorporate public keys into the system.
posts/2014-02-21-restful-email.md:41: Before I can POST to `gmail.com/michaeljburling`, I would have to get Michael's public key, and then use it and my private key to sign my message:
posts/2014-02-21-restful-email.md:45: GET gmail.com/michaeljburling/public_key POST gmail.com/michaeljburling Any messages with an invalid signature would go directly to spam, so [email spoofing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) would not be possible.

posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:5: Applying principles of natural language linguistics to programming languages --- *What follows is an mildly revised version of a final paper from the linguistics pragmatics course I took last spring.* Programming language theory and theoretical linguistics are two fields with overlapping histories.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:12: However, most programming languages are not designed to behave like natural language.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:13: This post identifies research in the pragmatics of natural language for programming language theory researchers to adapt to programming language theory, and vice versa.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:21: To effectively synthesize these fields, we need to remember that programming languages are for people and not computers.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:22: People need to be able to effectively convey ideas in programming languages, as well as effectively understand ideas in programming languages.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:26: A common example of this is when a programmer is working on a team, other people will look at the code and need to understand it in order to know how to use it.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:28: A less common example, though just as important, is the diachronic situation:
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:31: Since this is the case, [Grice](http://ling.umd.edu/~alxndrw/Readings/Implicature/grice75.pdf)'s cooperative principle applies.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:34: On the other hand, the language is restricted in that it needs to be convertible into language for the computer to understand and evaluate efficiently.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:36: This limits the kind of grammars and the flexibility of the language designer, but does not prevent pragmatics from appearing in the design.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:42: This is usually an assumption.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:46: If too little is written (as in the `sed` programming language and 'one-liners'), the intent and function of the code is unclear.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:49: Relevance:* Do not write unnecessary things.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:55: The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) applies pragmatism (not pragmatics) to the workplace structure of a software engineer, so it would not seem as related as its title suggests.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:57: However, it does provide some tips to consider when designing and writing software.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:62: This corresponds to *Quantity,* since a lack of repetition results in a shorter program, but also to *Manner* since repetitive software could be unclear to subsequent programmers using the program.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:72: Another tip from The Pragmatic Programmer suggests the separation of concerns.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:73: This principle states that each section of code should only handle one concern.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:74: Intuitively, this corresponds to *Relevance*.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:76: Quality* is a harder maxim to identify since programs are generally considered to be correct if they run correctly.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:77: Some programming languages make more or less claims about their correctness.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:78: This seems to be the most highly weighted maxim for programming languages; the others can be flouted to satisfy *Quality*.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:85: For example, even in object-oriented languages where the class or prototype of an object is also an object, we cannot use a determiner with the class or prototype of the object to get an instance of that class or prototype.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:89: However, an analogy of determiners and adjectives can be made to database query languages and to object-relational mapping, which provides a bijective map of objects and rows in a relational database.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:98: SELECT FIRST(*) FROM Dogs WHERE color='red' AND size='big'; ~~~~ The semantics of this statement are similar to the English.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:103: This statement just gets some row from the table where the adjectives specified are satisfied.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:107: For definite determiners, such as "the big red dog", we want to make sure there is only one result which satisfies those conditions.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:112: SELECT a FROM (SELECT * FROM Dogs WHERE color='red' AND size='big') a WHERE COUNT(a)=1; ~~~~ Note that this is purely a semantic translation into SQL.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:119: Pragmatic reasoning should improve the result.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:120: If you only have one member of a class with those properties *in the current namespace*, then that should be what is referred to, and if there isn't one, check the next highest namespace.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:123: This is approximately how natural language works.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:130: However, if it utilized an existing big red dog (or if if failed to point to anything), then "the big red dog" escapes out of the current namespace and looks around trying to find somewhere else to provide an object to refer to.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:133: If we were walking outside, it might be to some dog we see, but there is also certain background knowledge in deeper namespaces which come in handy even when there is no local referent.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:137: This would be pragmatic reasoning, and would be implementable into a programming language.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:144: Some programming languages make use of anaphoric lexemes.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:145: This section explores current anaphoric structures in programming languages.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:152: Anaphoric lambdas are used to create recursive anonymous functions ([Let Over Lambda](http://www.letoverlambda.com/), Chapter 6).
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:153: Lambda expressions are used as anonymous functions in many programming languages, but it is difficult to represent recursive functions anonymously.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:157: Consider the following.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:157: We would like to represent the factorial function anonymously.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:159: However, this would not work, since the ellipsis represents recursion.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:160: Instead, we provide an anaphor `self` which can be used within the lambda expression to represent recursive calls to itself.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:162: With this in mind, we can write the following anonymous recursive function:
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:173: For example, when defining a class in Python, you use self to refer to the eventual instance of the class:
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:182: Person() location = Location() def run_to(self, object):
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:193: In other languages, the `self` in the methods would refer to the methods themselves, rather than the instance object of the class.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:194: This is more common in prototypal object-oriented languages (as opposite to classic), due to how prototypes work For example, JavaScript, which uses `this` in place of self, has this issue.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:197: As a work around to this (no pun intended), a common idiom is to create a `that` variable which refers to the object above the current one.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:216: Originally implemented in Smalltalk, cascade allows for programming language constructions similar to "the owner threw the stick, told the dog to fetch it, and watched the dog".
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:218: Here is that sentence translated into Smalltalk:
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:222: EmilyElizabeth threw:
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:227: Cascade is implemented by returning the object (`EmilyElizabeth`, in our case) from each method (hence 'method chaining'), rather than some some other object or an attribute of the object.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:233: EmilyElizabeth.threw(stick) .tell(Clifford, fetch, stick) .watch(Clifford) ~~~~ Another analogy can be made between Hoare triples and presupposition.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:242: Hoare [proposed](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=363259) a method of verifying program correctness using the following:
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:244: Pre-condition (Set of possible states) - Statement(s) - Post-condition (Set of possible states) To use Hoare triples, one specifies the expected post-condition for the program and works backward through each statement to find the needed precondition for the program.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:250: Each statement influences the conditions by changing the set of states, for example, by assignment.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:252: In an assignment statement, everything that previously was true about the right hand side of the assignment is now true about both the right hand side and the left hand side of the assignment.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:256: The pre-conditions are similar to presupposition.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:256: This later influenced the dynamic semantics approach to presupposition.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:262: In programming languages, typing is controversial, with some preferring strong static typing for reliability and efficiency, with others preferring weak dynamic typing for its flexibility.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:266: However, ignoring the social aspects, we may still be able to find a natural language analogy to [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference).
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:267: Type inference allows the computer to infer certain properties about the various objects under consideration.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:271: I simplified the language for the sake of demonstrating inference, but the principles apply to the larger language, too.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:287: We see `inc` takes an argument, so we know it must be of a function type, with some input type and some result type.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:291: We see `+` and know that plus takes two integers and that it takes in `a`, so `a` must be of type integer, and `inc` must take in and return integers.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:299: Here, we see `g` and see that it takes two arguments, so it must be a function that takes some argument and returns another function which takes another argument and returns a result.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:303: We see `(f i)` and know that `f` must be a function from the type of `i` to some other type.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:311: This analysis can be done either during compilation (static) or at runtime (dynamic).
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:312: Static type inference is similar to what the speaker of natural language does in sentence formation using semantics.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:314: Dynamic type inference (for example, duck typing) is similar to what the hearer does using pragmatic inference.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:319: Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract), an extension to type theory inspired by Hoare triples, provide additional means of software verification.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:320: Contracts are typically used to verify the pre- and post-conditions of a function by either runtime checking the arguments and results, or statically unifying the contracts of the various functions and their calling conditions.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:323: For a long time, this was difficult to do in languages with first class functions, since there would be a recursive check with no base case.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:326: Findler, et al.](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=581484) figured out how to include the base case, and extends contracts with the notion of higher-order contracts.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:329: Instead of typing variables, contracts provide limitations to the properties of the variables.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:330: We can use the correspondence between Sets and Boolean functions to efficiently represent and check these conditions:
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:332: Since conditions are just sets of possible states, each contract can be takes a state and returns boolean value as to whether it is in the set or not.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:336: Contracts therefore must have the contract `Any -> Boolean`.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:337: Since `Any` is a contract, it also has the contract `Any -> Boolean`, but `Any` is defined to always return true, so when checking the contracts of contracts, it ends up here.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:344: There are also contract combinators, which correspond to the Set and Boolean combinators.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:345: For example, the contract `-2 or Positive` takes the -2 contract which checks for equality with -2, and the Positive contract which checks for a positive number, and unifies them into a composite contract.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:351: These contract combinators along with a minimization function may provide a form of pragmatic reasoning for programming languages.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:352: A minimization function would take these contracts and simplify them.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:354: For example, `Number and Integer` simplifies to `Integer` since anything in `Integer` is also in `Number`.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:360: In programming languages, scope refers to the method of resolving variables to values.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:366: Dynamic scope uses a single namespace for variables, and thus searches through each activation record on the stack.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:368: Static scope only examines activation records which are deeper than the first occurrence of the namespace for that block.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:371: There does not seem to be much of a difference at first glance, but the implications are numerous.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:372: Static scope is unintuitive to implement, but intuitive to use, understand, and reason about within a programming language, and thus very few programming languages use dynamic scope.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:377: This notion of scope is similar to the admittance of [Karttunen](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00351935), and later dynamic semantics approaches.
posts/2014-02-24-the-linguistics-pragmatic-programmer.md:378: Perhaps the typology of programming languages can be used to inform our understanding of name resolution in natural language.

posts/2014-02-28-a-language-which-isnt-recursively-enumerable.md:4: A Language which isn't Recursively Enumerable --- We've been working through the [Chomsky hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy) at the computational linguistics reading group.
posts/2014-02-28-a-language-which-isnt-recursively-enumerable.md:7: This past week, the existence of a language which wasn't recursively enumerable came up.
posts/2014-02-28-a-language-which-isnt-recursively-enumerable.md:7: Here's my attempt at a solution.
posts/2014-02-28-a-language-which-isnt-recursively-enumerable.md:10: By definition, a [recursively enumerable language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursively_enumerable_language) is a language for which there exists a Turing machine which must halt on all strings in the language, but may not necessarily halt on strings not in the language.
posts/2014-02-28-a-language-which-isnt-recursively-enumerable.md:12: By definition, "a [universal Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine) (UTM) is a Turing machine which can simulate an arbitrary Turing machine on arbitrary input".
posts/2014-02-28-a-language-which-isnt-recursively-enumerable.md:14: The existence of a UTM requires a string-encoding of a Turing machine, that is, a string which can be interpreted by the UTM to simulate the described Turing machine.
posts/2014-02-28-a-language-which-isnt-recursively-enumerable.md:16: Since languages are sets of strings, the set of strings which describe Turing machines that halt for all inputs is a language, *L*.
posts/2014-02-28-a-language-which-isnt-recursively-enumerable.md:18: Due to the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem), there cannot exist a Turing machine which halts for all strings in *L*.
posts/2014-02-28-a-language-which-isnt-recursively-enumerable.md:20: Since the definition of a recursively enumerable language requires the existence of such a Turing machine, the language *L* is not recursively enumerable.
posts/2014-02-28-a-language-which-isnt-recursively-enumerable.md:22: While *L* is not recursively enumerable, supersets of *L* may be recursively enumerable.

posts/2014-04-05-marketing-your-linguistics-degree.md:9: I was interested in cognitive science, but it isn't offered as an undergraduate major, so I took the introductory psychology course.
posts/2014-04-05-marketing-your-linguistics-degree.md:9: It wasn't what I was looking for, so I then took the introductory linguistics course, with a plan to go on to neuroscience if it didn't work out.
posts/2014-04-05-marketing-your-linguistics-degree.md:9: Since then, I developed my computer skills and got a research job doing software development with a linguistic focus.
posts/2014-04-05-marketing-your-linguistics-degree.md:11: I have not had specific goals for my career path; I just try apply to everything that sounds interesting and don't get down when I get rejected.
posts/2014-04-05-marketing-your-linguistics-degree.md:13: I use the approaches I learned in historical linguistics and linguistic analysis every day for debugging, both for the software at my job, but also for debugging the world around me.
posts/2014-04-05-marketing-your-linguistics-degree.md:17: During college, it is hard to justify writing outside of class because of time spent on in-class writing, but after college, make sure you keep writing.
posts/2014-04-05-marketing-your-linguistics-degree.md:17: In addition to maintaining the technical skill of writing, writing regularly helps people organize their thoughts and allows them to become more effective at what they do.
posts/2014-04-05-marketing-your-linguistics-degree.md:19: If you have or are getting a linguistics major and are looking for some direction, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:mare0132@umn.edu).
posts/2014-04-07-effective-requirements.md:2: Effective Requirements tags:
posts/2014-04-07-effective-requirements.md:9: When requirements are vague, it is difficult to know what direction to go in, or whether the end result will be what the client is looking for.
posts/2014-04-07-effective-requirements.md:9: On the other hand, when the client can afford to experiment, vague requirements sometimes provide for novel solutions which the implementers would not have discovered had the requirements been more specific.
posts/2014-04-07-effective-requirements.md:11: When non-programmers attempt pseudocode, it can lead to logically inconsistent requirements.
posts/2014-04-07-effective-requirements.md:11: Instead, when the client cannot afford to learn programming, the requirements should solely detail the needs of the client rather than the specific logic that needs implementing.
posts/2014-04-07-effective-requirements.md:11: On the other hand, providing pseudocode in the requirements makes implementation more straightforward, at least initially.
posts/2014-04-07-effective-requirements.md:15: Cook](http://www.johndcook.com/) blogged about [patches and specs](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/04/05/patches-and-specs/) today.
posts/2014-04-07-effective-requirements.md:15: I've not yet had time to view [the video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/3-642) he linked to, but here's the quote he selected:
posts/2014-04-07-effective-requirements.md:17: Every time code is patched, it becomes a little uglier, harder to understand, harder to maintain, bugs get introduced.

posts/2014-04-13-minneapolis-food-deserts.md:9: Mary Pattison](http://mary.marek-spartz.org), my fiancée, is currently taking an urban planning course for her master's degree in GIS.
posts/2014-04-13-minneapolis-food-deserts.md:9: For her final project, she collected a list of grocery stores in Minneapolis and used a [Euclidean distance](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//009z0000001p000000) analysis to calculate minimum walking distance of any point in Minneapolis to a grocery store.

posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.md:4: Fox hunting equipement --- For her master's coursework, [Mary](http://www.marypattison.com) is taking a class on spatial data methodology.
posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.md:7: She wanted to do a radio direction finding final project, but since I haven't done much with my ham radio license recently, this was a good chance to invest in some equipment:
posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.md:9: Adept Instruments](http://www.adeptco.com/adeptinstruments/) [T400P-6 fox hunting transmitter](http://www.adeptco.com/adeptinstruments/fox.htm).*](/images/2014-04-17-foxhunt/T400-6P1.gif) It transmits using AM on the 70 cm band.
posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.md:13: Cushcraft](http://www.cushcraftamateur.com/) [A270-6S Yagi antenna](http://www.cushcraftamateur.com/Product.php?productid=A270-6S).*](/images/2014-04-17-foxhunt/A270-6S.jpg) This antenna is two 3-element Yagi antennas, one each for the 2 m and 70 cm bands.
posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.md:15: For now, we've only assembled the 70 cm antenna, but we'll put together the rest before our [next fox hunt](http://hamoperator.com/Park/), as it will use 2 m.
posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.md:17: Yaesu](http://yaesu.com/) [VX-3R handheld transceiver](http://yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&ProdCatID=111&encProdID=5CB596EBED9A3EE26635C7E1F02500D9).* ](/images/2014-04-17-foxhunt/VX-3R.jpg) I've used this handheld before, and have always been impressed with its durability, battery life, and receiver coverage.
posts/2014-04-22-fox-hunting-software.md:4: Software used for fox hunting --- Another piece of "equipment" that I forgot to mention in [yesterday's post](/posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.html) is [Fox Hunt](http://foxhunt.rail.com/foxhunt/Home.html), an application for the iPhone which uses the phone's GPS and magnetometer to do orienteering.
posts/2014-04-22-fox-hunting-software.md:7: In addition, it will attempt to suggest a location of the fox once enough bearings are entered.

posts/2014-04-25-decomposition-as-task-management.md:4: Decompose until a computer can do it --- When faced with a challenge, and you don't know the next step, decompose your challenge into smaller challenges.
posts/2014-04-25-decomposition-as-task-management.md:9: When programming, your challenge should eventually be one that the computer can solve for you.

posts/2014-04-29-preemptive-maintenance.md:7: Coincidentally, our local Subaru dealer had a coupon for a free multi-point inspection, so I took the car in for the inspection and got a list of quotes for all of the little non-essential things that would be nice to get fixed.

posts/2014-04-30-startup-services-startups.md:2: Startup Services Startups tags:
posts/2014-04-30-startup-services-startups.md:4: Startups that provide services for other startups --- One of the services we offer at [Celador](http://www.celador.mn) we like to call Startup as a Service.
posts/2014-04-30-startup-services-startups.md:9: Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/) and other startup accelerators are also startup services.
posts/2014-04-30-startup-services-startups.md:9: In addition to financial investment, the main service they offer is expertise and connections.
posts/2014-04-30-startup-services-startups.md:9: The trick here is to fund enough startups that the successful ones can hire the founders of the unsuccessful ones.
posts/2014-04-30-startup-services-startups.md:11: Co-working spaces and hackerspaces such as the [Hacker Dojo](http://www.hackerdojo.com/) offer another sort of service, albeit targeted more toward the individual, as individuals typically pay for membership.
posts/2014-04-30-startup-services-startups.md:13: I'd be curious to see in a startup services startup which would offer the expertise and connections of an accelerator but also provide working space without money being invested.
posts/2014-04-30-startup-services-startups.md:13: The target client would be a startup either in or just out of an accelerator, and the payment would be with equity.
posts/2014-04-30-startup-services-startups.md:13: My impression of accelerators has been that they don't generally provide much for working space, but I may be wrong.
posts/2014-05-01-fox-hunting-results.md:4: Fox Hunting Results --- Last month, I posted about fox hunting [equipment](/posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.html) and [software](/posts/2014-04-22-fox-hunting-software.html) that [Mary](http://www.marypattison.com) and her friend Emily used[^1] for a final project.
posts/2014-05-01-fox-hunting-results.md:7: I forgot to mention some other tools:
posts/2014-05-01-fox-hunting-results.md:9: First, I put the transmitter in a known location, then we went around our neighborhood to take bearings from a few different locations.
posts/2014-05-01-fox-hunting-results.md:11: Mary and Emily taking a bearing.](/images/2014-04-17-foxhunt/mary-and-emily.jpg) Mary and Emily took their bearings and locations (including the transmitter locations), imported them into ArcGIS to show how triangulation can be used to estimate a transmitter location.
posts/2014-05-01-fox-hunting-results.md:13: The transmitter can be assumed to be within the intersections of successful bearings.
posts/2014-05-01-fox-hunting-results.md:15: One of the resulting maps.](/images/2014-04-17-foxhunt/second-location.jpg) Mary and I are planning on attending [HF in the Park](http://www.hamoperator.com/Park/) next Saturday, where there will be an organized fox hunt.
posts/2014-05-01-fox-hunting-results.md:17: We'll have to assemble the 2m portion of our Yagi antenna, but we're looking forward to refining our newly acquired skills.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:2: Compiler Optimizations and Optimality Theory tags:
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:4: Compiler optimizations and optimality theory --- Yesterday, I read a [post](http://gus-massa.blogspot.com/2014/04/removing-strange-t-and-f-of-ifs-in.html) on bytecode optimizations in Racket.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:7: The post discusses a number of optimizations (both proposed and implemented) for `if`-expressions in the Racket compiler.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:9: Of particular interest is optimization *h*, which despite optimizing many redundant `if`-expressions, introduces a few trivially redundant expressions, such as `(if #t a b)`, which should just be `a`.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:9: The solution proposed introduces three more optimizations *i, j, k* to account for these cases.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:11: Another observation from the Racket post was that there are cases where bytecode could have improvements and regressions with the optimizations ordered one way, and have different improvements and regressions with the optimizations ordered a different way.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:13: Optimality Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimality_theory) (OT) was created to account for this.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:13: It eschews the rule-based approach for a constraint and search approach, so that rules can apply in different orders in different cases.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:15: Given a underlying representation, *GEN* generates an infinite list of all possible outputs.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:15: EVAL* then considers each candidate against the ordered constraints for the language.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:17: By analogy, a graph search algorithm could be used to evaluate bytecode according to a specific set of ordered constraints.
posts/2014-05-02-compiler-optimizations-and-optimality-theory.md:17: Instead of applying rules in a linear order, each transformation rule would provide a new node in the graph.

posts/2014-05-08-your-service-as-a-functor.md:7: Most of the discussion regarding this paper seems focused on *futures*, but I've been thinking a lot about *services* and *filters*.
posts/2014-05-08-your-service-as-a-functor.md:7: The following discussion is not dependent on an understanding of futures.
posts/2014-05-08-your-service-as-a-functor.md:12: Request -> Response ``` Services can be parameterized by other services:[^1] ```Haskell authorizedWwwService ::
posts/2014-05-08-your-service-as-a-functor.md:18: Service -> Service -> Service authorizedWwwService authService wwwService request | authService `authorizes` request = wwwService request | otherwise = unauthorizedMessage authService ``` [^1]:
posts/2014-05-08-your-service-as-a-functor.md:24: Type classes should specify the interface of the parameterized services to improve type safety, but that's beyond the scope of this post.
posts/2014-05-08-your-service-as-a-functor.md:29: Request, Service) -> Response ``` However, if we curry the arguments, and swap the order of the `Request` and the `Service`, we get the following:
posts/2014-05-08-your-service-as-a-functor.md:35: Service -> Request -> Response ``` Noting that the return type of `Filter'` is `Request -> Response`, which is just `Service`.
posts/2014-05-08-your-service-as-a-functor.md:46: Another approach would be to make `Service` an instance of `Functor`, which is more-or-less done in the paper using the filter combinators (specifically `andThen`).

posts/2014-05-12-hf-in-the-park.md:9: We assembled the 2 meter portion of our [Cushcraft A270-6S](/posts/2014-04-21-fox-hunting-equipment.html) for the fox hunt, as it was on the 2 meter band.
posts/2014-05-15-adding-tags-to-posts-with-hakyll.md:4: Adding tags to posts with Hakyll --- I've added tags to this blog using [Javran](https://javran.github.io/)'s [tutorial](https://javran.github.io/posts/2014-03-01-add-tags-to-your-hakyll-blog.html).
posts/2014-05-21-reusing-generators-in-python.md:23: There was an issue with the `for`-loop, so the print statement was added in, but this changed the behavior of the program.
posts/2014-05-21-reusing-generators-in-python.md:23: Since the generator would be exhausted anyway, we can get the expected behavior without additional cost by doing the following:

posts/2014-05-23-datetime-interval-now-on-pypi.md:7: Python's builtin [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) module provides useful representations of points in time (`date` and `datetime`) as well as durations of time (`timedelta`).
posts/2014-05-23-datetime-interval-now-on-pypi.md:7: However, it does not provide a representation of an interval of time, starting at a specific point and lasting for a duration.
posts/2014-05-23-datetime-interval-now-on-pypi.md:7: A representation such as this would be useful for representing calendar events.

posts/2014-05-23-datetime-interval-now-on-pypi.md:9: PeriodicInterval` provides a representation for recurring events, with a period and a count of occurrences.
posts/2014-05-23-datetime-interval-now-on-pypi.md:14: This wouldn't work on PeriodicInterval, as recurring intervals have a different semantics in ISO 8601.

posts/2014-05-23-wx-now-open-source.md:9: Instead of having the weather station be its own web server, since it may go in and out of range of the internet or lose power, I decided to make a web app and deploy it elsewhere.

posts/2014-06-06-swift-programming-language.md:4: Some thoughts on Swift --- [Apple](https://www.apple.com) surprised the world at this year's [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/):
posts/2014-06-06-swift-programming-language.md:7: They have been secretly working on a new programming language, [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), designed to minimize their reliance on Objective-C.
posts/2014-06-06-swift-programming-language.md:9: Considering that Objective-C augments the semantics of C with the syntax of Smalltalk, this would imply that we would be left with the syntax Smalltalk.
posts/2014-06-06-swift-programming-language.md:9: Instead, one could say that Swift has the semantics of Smalltalk (or [Strongtalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongtalk)) with the syntax of C.
posts/2014-06-06-swift-programming-language.md:11: While reading the [introduction to Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097), I felt that the closest pre-existing language was Dart.
posts/2014-06-06-swift-programming-language.md:11: There are quite a few differences, but there seems to be some convergent evolution.
posts/2014-06-06-swift-programming-language.md:11: Given [Lars Bak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Bak_%28computer_programmer%29)'s work on Strongtalk, this isn't too surprising.
posts/2014-06-06-swift-programming-language.md:11: Both are a departure from the Java and C++ object-orientation style, incorporating progress from type theory along the way.
posts/2014-06-06-swift-programming-language.md:13: I have a few issues with some of their language design decisions (which I plan to discuss in the coming weeks), but overall they made some good decisions (playgrounds!).

posts/2014-06-15-ken-thompson-on-fragile-code.md:7: My definition of fragile code is, suppose you want to add a feature–good code, there's one place where you add that feature and it fits; fragile code, you've got to touch ten places.
posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:7: This past week there was a [post](https://medium.com/@owensd/swift-json-parsing-716ea9be1c5b) criticizing Swift's static typing as limiting when it comes to "parsing" JSON.
posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:7: They weren't really parsing JSON, rather just extracting values from a specific point in the structure, but the point remains:
posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:7: Swift's static typing makes it difficult to extract values from a dynamic structure.
posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:7: The [redditors](http://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/28g72k/swift_json_parsing_help_me_with_the_errors_of_my/) didn't have much to say, except for [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/28g72k/swift_json_parsing_help_me_with_the_errors_of_my/ciaop9l) [voices](http://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/28g72k/swift_json_parsing_help_me_with_the_errors_of_my/ciapp9h) of reason, who weren't understood.
posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:7: Most of the redditors seemed to insist that JSON is fully schema-less and thus should have `AnyObject` as its representation, to keep things fully dynamic.
posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:9: Since they used `AnyObject` to represent a JSON object, this caused their frustration with [downcasting](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TypeCasting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH22-XID_446).
posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:9: Instead, let's make a library using static typing to help us out, by building an [algebraic data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) representing all possible JSON objects.
posts/2014-06-20-json-parsing-in-swift.md:9: According to [JSON.org](http://json.org/), we have *values* which can be *objects*, *arrays*, *strings*, *numbers*, *booleans*, or `null`.

posts/2014-06-25-developers-and-depression.md:7: While society tends to compensate them well financially, their mental condition is often overlooked.
posts/2014-06-25-developers-and-depression.md:7: Given how important mental condition is to successful development, one would think employers and educators would pay closer attention and provide resources for developers.
posts/2014-06-25-developers-and-depression.md:7: This stems from lack of awareness, which in turn is due to stigma discouraging open discussion about these issues.
posts/2014-06-25-developers-and-depression.md:9: In August, [Greg Baugues](http://baugues.com/) from [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) will be giving a talk on developers and depression at the [Minnesota PHP user group](http://www.meetup.com/mn-php/).

posts/2014-06-27-uploading-to-pypi.md:4: Tom Christie gave a guide on uploading to PyPI --- Yesterday, my co-worker, [Tom Christie](https://tom-christie.github.io/), posted a guide on [uploading Python modules to PyPI](https://tom-christie.github.io/articles/pypi/).
posts/2014-06-27-uploading-to-pypi.md:7: I've done this a few times, but haven't had to deal with a package as complicated as the one he was uploading, since the packages I've uploaded are pure Python.
posts/2014-06-27-uploading-to-pypi.md:7: His package compiles a C program which gets called by the Python library, and provides some [pickled](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html) data to minimize recomputation.
posts/2014-06-27-uploading-to-pypi.md:9: One thing I noticed was the suggestion to use [`twine`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine/1.3.0) to minimize transmission of PyPI passwords in plaintext.
posts/2014-06-27-uploading-to-pypi.md:9: I'm not sure why `pip` doesn't use HTTPS to interact with PyPI directly, but I suspect this to be fixed upstream before too long.

posts/2014-07-09-email-clients.md:32: Additionally, the clever foldering it uses makes it difficult to use with other email clients.

posts/2014-07-17-hackage-code-review.md:7: Danny Gratzer](http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/about.html), the organizer of [HaskellMN](http://www.haskell.mn), has been reviewing packages from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/) to demonstrate his approach to understanding new code.
posts/2014-07-17-hackage-code-review.md:7: So far he's reviewed [`logict`](http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/posts/2014-07-10-reading-logict.html), a [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) [monad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29), and [`extensible-effects`](http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/posts/2014-07-15-reading-extensible-effects.html), an alternative to the [monad-transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_transformer) approach.
posts/2014-07-17-hackage-code-review.md:7: They're good reads even if you don't know any Haskell, as he describes how he traverses files in a code base using [`find`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find) and [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep).
posts/2014-07-19-swift-changes-array-type-syntax.md:7: I keep forgetting to mention that Apple has fixed one of the issues I had with Swift.
posts/2014-07-19-swift-changes-array-type-syntax.md:8: In Beta 3, the syntax for Array at the type level has changed from `String[]` to `[String]`, which corresponds better to the value-level syntax for Arrays.
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:7: A case of accidental prioritization.* In January, I started using [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com) to track my blogging.
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:11: However, because each post had the same value, I had inadvertently set my sights for quantity over quality.
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:20: Naively, I could change my goal to be *N* words per week (where *N* is initially my historic rate), but this would result in a different accidental prioritization of quantity over quality:
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:25: Instead, I'm developing a quality measurement using natural language processing, and incorporating it into [`mindfeed`](http://kyle.marek-spartz.org/posts/2014-05-29-mindfeed.html).
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:28: I'm unsure how exactly to calculate quality, so instead of guessing, I'm developing a set of features each of which I'll mind[^1] with Beeminder separately.
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:35: Beeminder.
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:38: I'll also look at vocabulary diversity using the count of [types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-token_distinction) as well as an information-theoretic approach.
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:40: I will also be tracking readability measures such as the [Flesch–Kincaid index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_Readability_Test).
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:43: Another aspect to consider is uniqueness relative to previous posts.
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:44: This can be simple, such as how many new words were introduced in this blog post, or more complex, such as [vector-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model) [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_%28mathematics%29).
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:49: Measurements are important, as they do change behavior, but what we measure can sometimes have unintended consequences.
posts/2014-07-21-quantity-and-quality.md:50: Choose your metrics carefully.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:4: A comparison of imports in Python, Haskell, and Swift --- At the last [HaskellMN](http://www.haskell.mn) meetup, [Danny Gratzer](http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/) had a question about Python imports.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:12: Python some_constant = 3.14 from a import some_constant from b import some_constant ~~~ **Edit:** He had a [follow-up question](/posts/2014-08-06-imports-continued.html).
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:31: Python has a few [import styles](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#import):
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:47: The third is frowned upon, as you can accidentally overwrite variables if a module you import later provides an object with the same name as one you import earlier.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:50: Additionally, providing a list of what is going to be used in the file is useful from a documentation standpoint.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:71: This is a double-edged sword, useful for both making and breaking circular dependencies.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:80: Haskell import qualified Module1 import Module2 (a, b, c) import Module3 ~~~ The first loads `Module1` and brings it into scope.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:91: These correspond loosely to the three Python examples, however, I put them in the roughly similar semantic order, rather than by ordering them by their similar syntax.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:105: Haskell module Module where ... ~~~ The convention is to put them in the corresponding file structure, though this is not enforced programmatically.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:113: Unlike Python imports, Haskell imports need to be at the top of a file, optionally following a module declaration.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:116: Haskell provides the `as` option, too, though only for module-level imports:
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:119: Haskell import Module as M import qualified Module as M ~~~ However, the first example here also imports everything from `Module` in addition to qualifying the module-level import as `M`.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:133: Swift imports](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Declarations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH34-XID_499) are not as diverse.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:148: Compared to the `module2` examples from Python and Haskell, the example here provides two additional constraints.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:165: Python from module import var a, var b, var c import module (var a, var b, var c) ~~~ Like Python, Swift imports [can](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=7) be placed anywhere within a file.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:177: Importing a module name is fine, though it can make some code hard to read due to the repetitive and verbose nature of including the module name for each access into the module.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:184: Importing everything from a module without naming each item is frowned upon because it doesn't convey everything to readers of the code.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:185: Code readers like to be able to see what is in scope in order to get a feel for what kind of code will be read in a file.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:189: Additionally, if multiple modules define items with the same name, it is possible to overwrite imports implicitly, without notifying the reader:
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:193: Python x = 1 x = 2 from a import * from b import * print(x) ~~~ These suggestions are reflected in Python's [PEP 8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports) and the HaskellWiki page on ["Import[ing] modules properly"](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Import_modules_properly).
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:209: These discuss the merits of the various import styles, and they arrive at similar conclusions, though the HaskellWiki page is less axiomatic and provides more rationale for the various decisions.
posts/2014-08-05-imports.md:212: There is not yet a similar document for Swift, though the official blog post on [Files and Initialization](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=7) mentions that you "can even import modules at the bottom of the file (although that is not recommended Swift style.

posts/2014-08-06-imports-continued.md:7: I sent [yesterday's post about imports](/posts/2014-08-05-imports.html) to [Danny Gratzer](http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/).
posts/2014-08-06-imports-continued.md:9: He had a follow-up question:
posts/2014-08-06-imports-continued.md:14: Haskell module Foo (module X) where import Data.Text as X import Data.ByteString as X import Control.Lens as X ~~~ The following should accomplish the same result, though it isn't as concise due to Python's lack of an embedded module language.
posts/2014-08-06-imports-continued.md:23: In Python, file structure [determines](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#packages) modules (and packages).
posts/2014-08-06-imports-continued.md:28: There is [ongoing work](http://plv.mpi-sws.org/backpack/index.html) to improve Haskell's module language.
posts/2014-08-06-imports-continued.md:33: Python from data.text import * from data.byte_string import * from control.lens import * import foo.x as x from foo import x ~~~ I wouldn't recommend these sorts of tricks as the import order affects what is in scope, e.g.
posts/2014-08-06-imports-continued.md:48: Ideally import order should not matter as it is an implementation detail that should be hidden by a module.
posts/2014-08-06-imports-continued.md:49: A language (or [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29)) can enforce that property by preventing imports with conflicting names in general.

posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:2: Parallelizing algorithms in Haskell tags:
posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:4: I demonstrate parallelizing existing code in Haskell --- I've been working through [*Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/index.html).
posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:9: In my [last post](/posts/2014-08-26-concurrent-implementation-of-the-daytime-protocol-in-haskell.html), I demonstrated the facilities Haskell provides for lightweight concurrency.
posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:15: As a brief example, let's parallelize [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)[^1].
posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:18: Code .literate .haskell} import Control.Parallel.Strategies ``` [Strategies](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parallel-3.2.0.4/docs/Control-Parallel-Strategies.html) provide a means to tell the run-time system how to evaluate objects.
posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:24: We'll be using `rseq` is the sequential evaluation strategy, and `parList` takes a strategy for list items, and uses that strategy for each list element in parallel.
posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:28: Here's our non-parallelized Quicksort implementation:
posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:30: Code .literate .haskell} quicksort ::

posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:46: Code .literate .haskell} parallelsort ::
posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:47: Ord a => [a] -> [a] parallelsort [] = [] parallelsort (x:xs) = let leftPartition = [y | y <- xs, y < x] `using` parList rseq rightPartition = [y | y <- xs, y >= x] `using` parList rseq left = parallelsort leftPartition right = parallelsort rightPartition in left ++ [x] ++ right ``` We simply tell the run-time system what strategy to use for the list comprehensions.
posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:60: This doesn't really improve much in this case, but when used judiciously, extending your existing code with parallelism is straight-forward in Haskell.
posts/2014-08-28-parallelizing-algorithms-in-haskell.md:64: This post is also [available](/files/parallelsort.lhs) as a [literate Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Literate_programming) file.

posts/2014-10-28-glabal.md:4: Global sandboxes for Cabal --- I recently moved to a new laptop and decided to rethink my GHC and [`cabal`](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/) setup.
posts/2014-10-28-glabal.md:8: After installing [GHC for Mac OS X](http://ghcformacosx.github.io/) and running `cabal install cabal-install`, I decided not to install any other cabal packages globally in order to avoid [cabal hell](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cabal+hell).
posts/2014-10-28-glabal.md:14: I asked [Tyler Holien](https://twitter.com/tylerholien) what he does, and he suggested a separate cabal sandbox for each program and a [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) to the resulting binary somewhere on my [`$PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_%28variable%29).
posts/2014-10-28-glabal.md:34: If this doesn't complete successfully, I either `rm -r .install/pandoc` or go into the sandbox manually and attempt to recover.

posts/2014-12-01-benchmarking-large-riak-data-types.md:4: A benchmark for large (10k+ elements) Riak Data Types --- [Riak 2.0](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/intro-v20/) includes Data Types which provide reasonable guarantees with regard to eventual consistency.
posts/2014-12-01-benchmarking-large-riak-data-types.md:9: However, the data types, as implemented, aren't really designed to be performant with a large number of elements.
posts/2014-12-01-benchmarking-large-riak-data-types.md:12: To that end, here's a benchmark which demonstrates the behavior of large maps and sets using the [Riak Ruby Client](https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/).
posts/2014-12-01-benchmarking-large-riak-data-types.md:16: Then, using the data-type API, it reads, adds an element, and reads twice.

posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:2: Eventual consistency for SQL databases tags:
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:4: Using a log-structured schema, we can merge SQL databases to achieve eventual consistency.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:7: Eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) is typically thought of as a property of certain NoSQL databases.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:8: However, SQL databases can achieve eventual consistency with adequate planning.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:11: Eventual consistency is particularly useful for horizontally scaling web services, as each node does not need the full, up to date picture.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:12: Another use case is synchronizing mobile applications with intermittent network connectivity.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:14: In both cases, partitioning or [sharding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_%28database_architecture%29) allows each user or client to maintain a consistent view.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:18: A data structure is considered eventually consistent if two instances can reach a consistent state given the same unordered set of state changes.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:22: Strong eventual consistency can be achieved if state changes are [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property), [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property), and [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:27: State changes are commutative if swapping two operations yields the same state.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:28: For example, these two operations can apply in either order to yield a logically equivalent table:
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:31: SQL INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) VALUES (1); INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) VALUES (2); ~~~ Similarly, state changes are associative if three operations can be paired either way yielding the same state.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:37: For example, three databases each with one of the following operations can be merged as (1 + 2) + 3 or 1 + (2 + 3) to yield a logically equivalent table:
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:41: SQL INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) VALUES (1); INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) VALUES (2); INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) VALUES (3); ~~~ Not all [SQL DML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language) can be commutative or associative:
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:50: SQL UPDATE some_table SET a = 1; UPDATE some_table SET a = 2; UPDATE some_table SET a = 3; ~~~ Depending on the order of these operations, the resulting database would be in different states.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:59: Given two databases, where one has ran a deletion and one has not, merging them would re-insert the deleted row in the database with the deletion:
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:63: SQL DELETE FROM some_table WHERE some_column = 4; ~~~ We can limit DML to `SELECT`s and `INSERT`s to avoid using other synchronization methods.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:68: Avoiding updates and deletes provides [immutability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object), which guarantees a row will not change or disappear from our databases.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:72: By staying `INSERT`-only, we treat our database as a [persistent data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure), or an append-only commit log.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:76: Immutability and persistence helps with eventual consistency, but they are not sufficient.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:77: We also need idempotence.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:77: State changes are idempotent if repeatedly applying the same state change yields the same state.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:78: Our previous example, `INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) VALUES (1)` is not idempotent, unless we de-duplicate rows at query time:
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:82: SQL SELECT DISTINCT some_column FROM some_table; ~~~ Another way to achieve idempotence is to use a unique constraint to prevent duplicates from being inserted and ignore unique constraint violations upon insertion.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:91: SQL INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) SELECT 4 WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM some_table WHERE some_column = 4 ); ~~~ How can we delete an item from our database without using SQL `DELETE`?
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:106: SQL INSERT INTO some_table_deletions (some_table_id) VALUES (123456); ~~~ Queries for undeleted rows then become:
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:113: SQL SELECT some_table.* FROM some_table WHERE id NOT IN ( SELECT some_table_id FROM some_table_deletions ); ~~~ If we want to support deletion and re-adding of the same value, we cannot use a unique constraint for idempotence since the unique constraint would prevent the addition of the new row.
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:124: Instead, either de-duplicate at query time using `DISTINCT` or prevent duplicates from getting inserted without using a unique constraint:
posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.md:128: SQL INSERT INTO some_table (some_column) SELECT 4 WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM some_table WHERE some_column = 4 AND id NOT IN ( SELECT some_table_id FROM some_table_deletions ) ); ~~~ At this point it looks like we'll need to [normalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) our database, or structure our data in a particular way in order to satisfy these properties.

posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:4: Using a log-structured schema, we can merge SQL databases to achieve eventual consistency.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:7: Previously, I [introduced](http://kyle.marek-spartz.org/posts/2015-09-08-eventual-consistency-for-sql-databases.html) eventual consistency for SQL.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:9: This post illustrates how to normalize an eventually consistent SQL database.* To demonstrate how to normalize for eventual consistency, let's design a database for a Twitter clone, consisting of users and statuses.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:16: SQL CREATE TABLE Users ( username VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(255), phone VARCHAR(255), location VARCHAR(255), confirmed BOOLEAN NOT NULL, salt VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, hashed_password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE Statuses ( content VARCHAR(140) NOT NULL, created_at DATE DEFAULT ( SYSDATE ) NOT NULL, username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL, ) PRIMARY KEY (content, created_at, user_id); CREATE TABLE Follows ( follower_username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL, followee_username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL ) PRIMARY KEY (follower_username, followee_username); ~~~ The first step in normalizing for eventual consistency is to identify state changes in your data.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:41: Under the schema above, the following `UPDATE` statement would get executed:
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:44: SQL UPDATE Users SET confirmed = true WHERE username = 'kmarekspartz'; ~~~ However, since we're avoiding `UPDATE`, this will not work.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:50: Instead, let's normalize this mutation out of our database.[^1] [^1]:
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:53: I'm going to assume offline migrations for simplicity, but these migrations can be achieved in a zero-downtime environment, too.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:54: You would create both places for the data reside, deploy a version of the application to read from both, deploy a version of the application to write to both, run a backfill migration (like in the example), then deploy a version which only reads and writes the new place, then drop the old place.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:60: SQL CREATE TABLE Confirmations ( username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL ); INSERT INTO Confirmations SELECT username FROM Users WHERE confirmed = true; ALTER TABLE Users DROP COLUMN confirmed; INSERT INTO Confirmations VALUES ('kmarekspartz'); SELECT Users.*, IS_NULL(Confirmations.username) AS confirmed FROM Users LEFT OUTER JOIN Confirmations ON Users.username = Confirmations.username; ~~~ Applying this normalization to the rest of the schema would lead to a new schema:
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:84: SQL CREATE TABLE Users ( username VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY, salt VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, hashed_password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE Confirmations ( username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE Emails ( email VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY ); CREATE TABLE UserEmails ( username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Emails (email) NOT NULL ) PRIMARY KEY (username, email); CREATE TABLE Phones ( phone VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY ); CREATE TABLE UserPhones ( username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL, phone VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Phones (phone) NOT NULL ) PRIMARY KEY (username, phone); CREATE TABLE Locations ( location VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY ); CREATE TABLE UserLocations ( user_location_id PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL, location VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Locations (location) NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE UserLocationDeletions ( user_location_id REFERENCES UserLocations (user_location_id) NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE Statuses ( content VARCHAR(140) NOT NULL, created_at DATE DEFAULT ( SYSDATE ) NOT NULL, username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL, ) PRIMARY KEY (content, created_at, user_id); CREATE TABLE Follows ( follow_id PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, follower_username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL, followee_username VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES Users (username) NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE FollowDeletions ( follow_id REFERENCES Follows (follow_id) NOT NULL ); ~~~ I've turned most properties into many-to-many relationships, and added deletion tables for the join tables.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:145: This is because many-to-many relationships are easier to merge than one-to-one.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:148: This will result in temporary inconsistencies, but if you have each user interact with a particular host or shard, you can minimize those inconsistencies.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:150: In a mobile environment, the user is interacting with their phone, and we can guarantee that their phone is in a consistent state at any given time.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:152: In a server environment, we can route that user's interactions to a particular host, failing over to an in sync replica if that host is down.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:156: I left it as one-to-one, but passwords aren't needed anymore, particularly when there is an email address or a phone number available.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:158: This is one-factor authentication, but uses what is commonly a second factor in two-factor authentication.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:160: Removing passwords from this schema would make eventual consistency possible.
posts/2015-10-14-eventual-consistency-for-sql-normalization.md:165: I like to call this method of normalization 'log normalization' but that gets [confusing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution).
